Much of my career has been spent designing and building fully custom components from scratch. However, I also like to cater to the workflows of developers and often need to fit in to pre-established design choices of a large codebase that can't be instantly refactored. This is resource I made when I started working for a company that utilised the Bootstrap 5 CSS framework. The components in this library are responsive and make use of the latest features of Figma. For this community resource the Figma components exactly match up to the Bootstrap code. For my own designs I used a heavily modified and customized version of Bootstrap, as well as fully custom components when required.
